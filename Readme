Fuzzy logic API

Examples of using:

Composition of fuzzy number and fuzzy relation
http://127.0.0.1:5000/fuzzyNumberRelationComposition/[0.4,1,0.6]/[0.5,0.7,0.2,1,0.9,0.3]/2
is url for such input data as following
A = 0.4/x1+1/x2+0.6/x3 -- fuzzy number
R -- fuzzy relation (matrix)
R =  0.5    0.7
     0.2     1
     0.9    0.3
